This project is a Python implementation of the A* search algorithm to solve the N-Puzzle problem. The N-Puzzle problem involves sliding tiles on a board to achieve a specified goal configuration. The provided code is designed to find a solution for the 3x3 puzzle, but it can be adapted for other sizes.


Example

To test the program, you can use the following inputs:

Current State

1 2 3

4 5 6

_ 7 8

Goal State

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 _

The program will solve the puzzle and print the steps required to reach the goal state.
